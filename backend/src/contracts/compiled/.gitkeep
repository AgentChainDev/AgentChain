# Compiled Smart Contracts

This directory contains compiled Solidity smart contracts for AgentChain.

Files in this directory are generated automatically during the build process and should not be edited manually.

## Contents

When contracts are compiled, you'll find:

- `*.json` files containing contract ABI and bytecode
- Deployment artifacts
- Contract verification data

## Usage

These compiled contracts are used by:

- The blockchain core for contract deployment
- Frontend applications for contract interaction
- Testing framework for contract validation
- Development tools for debugging

## Build Process

Contracts are compiled using:

```bash
npm run compile-contracts
```

This process:
1. Reads Solidity files from `src/contracts/solidity/`
2. Compiles using the Solidity compiler
3. Outputs JSON artifacts to this directory
4. Generates TypeScript type definitions
