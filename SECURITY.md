## Known Security Considerations

### AI Validator Security

AI validators make autonomous decisions. While safeguards are in place, monitor validator behavior and report anomalies.

### Smart Contract Security

Smart contracts deployed to AgentChain should be audited before deployment. We recommend:

- Professional security audit
- Formal verification when possible
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Bug bounty program

### Network Security

AgentChain uses PoSA consensus. Security depends on:

- Validator honesty (4 of 6 required for consensus)
- Network peer validation
- Transaction signature verification
- State transition validation
